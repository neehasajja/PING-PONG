# pong_neural_net_live

##Overview
We build
the game of [Pong] from scratch. Then we build a [Deep Q Network] that gets better and better over time through trial and error. The DQN is a convolutional neural network that reads in pixel data from the game and the game score. Using just those 2 parameters, it learns what moves it needs to make to become better.

##Installation


* tensorflow 
* cv2 
* numpy
* random
* collections
* pygame

use [pip] to install the dependencies. Tensorflow and cv2 are more manual.
